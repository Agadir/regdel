URIs
====

Should Regdel (and Sinatra apps that I build) use a sitemap to generate URI
references for form actions, menu links, and rack-rewrite configuration?

For example, for new accounts, the URI for the form resource is specified in
at least the following places:

* config.ru
* regdel.rb
* public/s/xhtml/nav_menu.xsl

The problem here is that if the URI is updated, the value must be changed in all
three places.

One idea would be to build the html files via Rakefile. I'm trying this now and
it appears to be a good idea.
